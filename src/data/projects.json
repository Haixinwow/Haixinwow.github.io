Not only during team collaborations, but also during interruptions such as meetings, having to suddenly work on another project, or even just taking a break are major reasons these questions arise, as programmers have to regain the context, knowledge, and mental state to resume the work. Traditional text editors such as GitHub do provide a built-in history system, but they lack historical context behind the editing to answer such questions."

We have created this extension through a step-by-step process where one feature is built on top of another. We began with the interface design, where we created an interface that is intuitive for users. That created a solid foundation for the next mechanism of the extension in which the extension can generate subgoal summaries based on editing histories. In addition to displaying summarized user intentions, Code Histories also displays any web searches and links accessed by the programmers during the time when they were working on the subgoal. Lastly, we have integrated large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini to improve the user’s experience by letting the programmer search for a specific piece of history. Rather than being conversational, the LLMs are used to retrieve and filter relevant subgoal histories in response to the users’ questions/commands. With the help of Code History, programmers can now access contextualized histories and answer questions about the code that would otherwise be difficult to answer through a list of history alone."

                "value": "Programmer interruptions are common and disruptive. While research has focused on understanding their nature, impact, and associated recovery cost, others have looked at visual reminders of recent development actions as recovery support mechanisms. Until now, however, these have only extended as far as the timeline of source code change alone. Thus, there are opportunities to improve this information in a codebase's history to better support programmers' interruption recovery. We conducted a within-subjects exploratory study investigating how developers use code history during interruption recovery. We compared a new sub-goal history interface, which contextually organized code changes and web activity into sub-goals, with an existing chronological timeline tool support identified in the literature. Our findings reveal that developers significantly leveraged the sub-goal history interface more frequently during post-interruption recovery, suggesting its potential to improve how developers navigate past work. While not leading to a significant reduction in overall recovery time in this study, sub-goal history provided valuable support for integrating external resources, facilitated faster initial re-engagement, and showed a generally better recovery success rate. We observed developers employing diverse, multi-modal strategies, and, importantly, our results highlight recovery as a multi-stage process rather than a single event. These insights emphasize the crucial role of history-aware tool support for recovery workflows and underscore the need for designs that balance contextual detail with usability and adaptability to effectively support both developers' passive (reading through information) and active (searching for information) engagement with the recovery tool support."
